'''
The idea is to generate the number of people in each of the 4 large categories (male/female children/adults) first so that the total population would be close to the actual
distribution.

Then generate each household in a specific order based on the composition of the household.

Children are unique in that they cannot be alone in a household and can help us determine the age of the parents in the household.

1. We start by generating family households with 1 or 2 adults with children, using data on the number of children in households.
   Each household should subtract 2 or 1 adult and subtract the number of children from the population.
   This step should use up all the children in the population.

2. Family households without children
   Subtract 2 adults from the population.

3. Next, we generate non-family households (living alone and not living alone).
   Each household should subtract 1+ adult from the population.

Now the rest of the population consists of grandparents living with child/grandchild, other relatives, and some special cases.

4. Assign grandparents and other relatives to the existing family households.
   Add almost all of the remaining adults to a small portion of the households.

5. The remaining households are special cases.

5. Iterate through the generated households and refine the age to match the distribution.

This approach should not include any optimization and should be fast in generating the households.
